##Question 2

""" Objective: The aim of this assignment is to practice identifying and using Python's basic data types, as well as the type() function for checking a variable's data type.

Task 1: Code Correction Given below are some variable assignments. Your task is to identify the data type of each variable using type() and then use the print() function to print it out: """


""" variable_a = "Hello, World!"
variable_b = 23
variable_c = 3.14
variable_d = True """



variable_a = "Hello, World!"
variable_b = 23
variable_c = 3.14
variable_d = True

print("variable_a is a ", type(variable_a), "data type.")
print("variable_b is a ", type(variable_b), "data type.")
print("variable_c is a ", type(variable_c), "data type.")
print("variable_d is a ", type(variable_d), "data type.")
